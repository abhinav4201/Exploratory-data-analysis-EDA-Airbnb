        "Airbnb has revolutionized the way people travel and experience new places by providing a unique and personalized alternative to traditional hotel stays. By connecting hosts who have extra space in their homes or apartments with travelers looking for a more authentic and local experience, Airbnb has created a thriving community of people from all over the world who are passionate about exploring new cultures and sharing their own.\n",
        "\n",
        "As Airbnb has grown in popularity, the company has also recognized the value of data analysis in understanding its customers and hosts, making informed business decisions, and identifying new opportunities for growth. With millions of listings on its platform, Airbnb generates a vast amount of data that can be used to gain insights into the behavior and performance of hosts and guests.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset of approximately 49,000 Airbnb listings in order to gain a better understanding of the factors that drive success on the platform. The dataset includes both categorical and numeric variables, such as the location of the listing, the type of property, the price, the number of reviews, and the amenities offered.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key questions we can explore using this data is what sets successful hosts apart from those who may be struggling. By examining variables such as the number of bookings and reviews, the location of the listings, and the amenities offered, we can identify patterns and trends that may be correlated with higher levels of success. For example, we might find that hosts who are located in popular tourist destinations or who offer unique amenities such as a pool or hot tub tend to have higher bookings and better reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to studying the characteristics of individual hosts, we can also use the data to understand the factors that influence demand for Airbnb listings in different areas. By visualizing the data on a map, for example, we can see if certain neighborhoods or cities tend to have more listings or higher demand, and consider the possible reasons for these patterns. Factors such as the availability of local attractions, the cost of living, and the overall quality of life in an area may all play a role in determining the popularity of Airbnb listings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another area of interest for Airbnb is predicting future demand and pricing for its listings. By using machine learning techniques such as regression or classification, we can build models that can predict the likelihood of a listing being booked or the expected price based on factors such as the location, type of property, and amenities offered. These predictions can be valuable for both hosts and guests, as they can help hosts set competitive prices and guests make informed decisions about where to stay.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, data analysis can also be used to identify opportunities for Airbnb to improve its services and expand its offerings. For example, by analyzing customer feedback and host reviews, the company can identify areas where it can improve the user experience or offer new services that will be well received by its users. Similarly, by analyzing trends in demand and supply, Airbnb can identify new markets or demographics to target with its marketing efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the data generated by Airbnb's millions of listings provides a rich source of information that can be used to understand the behavior and preferences of hosts and guests, make informed business decisions, and identify new opportunities for growth and innovation. By exploring and analyzing this data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that drive success on Airbnb and use this knowledge to drive the company's continued success."

Secondly, it was important to deal with null values, therefore i changed the ***name*** and ***host_name*** null value with ***'not known'***. Since total count of number of review equal to zero was equal to the count of null values in ***review per month***, and as there was no review for the month therefore review per month should also be zero therefore, i changed null value with ***zero***. Thirdly, since ***minimum value*** for ***price*** was ***zero***, and since there is no specific data available why it was zero for example whether any discount was given or because of some other reason, therefore i changed zero value with ***median*** as median is less sensitive to the presence of outliers than the mean, and can provide a more accurate representation of the central tendency of the data in these cases. Then dumped the cleaned data into csv format for visual anlaysis in tableau. Finally ***dropped*** the ***last_review*** date column even though it can be used to know how old will be our data, but in the context of this analysis it may not be used.\n",
